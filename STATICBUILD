# STATICBUILD

Use this exact text to ask the assistant to create a static export (snapshot) of the site and produce a ZIP ready for upload to a static host.

---
Minimal (paste as-is):

Please build frontend and create a static site ZIP:
1) Run `npm ci` and `npm run build` in project root `codez`.
2) Start a local PHP server serving `public` on `127.0.0.1:8000` (use `php -S 127.0.0.1:8000 -t public`).
3) Fetch/render these routes: `/` (and optionally list other routes: `/projects`, `/services`).
4) Save rendered HTML into `static-export/`, copy the entire `public/` folder into `static-export/`.
5) Create ZIP `codez-static.zip` at project root containing `static-export/`.
6) Do NOT include `.env` or `vendor/` in the ZIP.
Return the full path to the ZIP and a short summary of included files.

---
Advanced (with options to pass):

Please create a static export and zip with these options:
- `routes`: comma-separated list of routes to render (default: `/`).
- `server`: command to start server (default: `php -S 127.0.0.1:8000 -t public`).
- `assets`: list of `public` subfolders to include (default: `build, css, js, img`).
- `output`: output ZIP path/name (default: `codez-static.zip`).
- `rewrite_absolute`: yes/no — rewrite absolute URLs to relative (default: no).

Example advanced prompt (paste as-is):

Create static export with these options:
- routes: `/ , /projects, /services`
- server: `php -S 127.0.0.1:8000 -t public`
- assets: `build, css, js, img`
- output: `codez-static.zip`
- rewrite_absolute: yes

Run the same steps as the Minimal flow. Return the ZIP path and a brief list of files inside the ZIP.

---
Notes and cautions:
- The assistant will NOT include `.env` or the `vendor/` directory in the static ZIP for security and size reasons — set environment variables on the host instead.
- A static export disables all server-side features (forms, DB-driven pages, auth). Use a full Laravel deploy for dynamic server behavior.
- If you need multiple pages, list them in `routes` so the assistant will fetch and include them in the export.

---
Local commands the assistant may run (for reference):

```
cd codez
npm ci
npm run build
php -S 127.0.0.1:8000 -t public
# then fetch pages and copy public/ into static-export/
# finally zip: codez-static.zip
```

Place this `STATICBUILD` file at the repo root and paste its contents as your prompt when you want an automated static export.
